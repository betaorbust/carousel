# Carousel

This is a demo of a carousel that is trying to hit the following criteria:

-   Works on browser back to Android 4.4.4 Webview (Chrome 30)
-   Can be used with touch, mouse, and keyboard
-   Is externally controlled so it can be used multiple times on the same page from the same source of truth.
-   Has infinite scrolling in either direction.
-   Works for both screen reader and keyboard users.
-   Can't rely on jquery > 1.1
-   Works in Right-to-Left layout directions.

The demo is available at [https://betaorbust.github.io/carousel](https://betaorbust.github.io/carousel)
